# Animata: Primitive Object Animations through Scripting Language

## Description
Animata is a web application designed to animate basic primitive objects (such as circles, rectangles, text) and can be extended to animate data structures and algorithms, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and sorting.

## Goals
The goal of Animata is to allow students to control and modify primitive objects (and in the future, data structures) through a custom scripting language and receive immediate visualized feedback based on the studentâ€™s alteration of code. Animata aims to provide students the opportunity to develop a complete understanding of various dynamic processes of core computer science principles through interaction and visualization of the data structures. The final product is a modern, web-based application (developed in Node.js and React.js) and can be used as supplemental learning in introductory college-level CS courses.
