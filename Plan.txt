In progress:
- Highlight line of code (or display current line num)
- Clean design of buttons
- Intro of draft

TODO:
- Refactor: JavaDoc comments + refactor all methods
- Use Map to track reference array of object
- Error checking of user input
- animate group of objects


Done:
- moveRelative should be controlled by the Canvas
- moveRelative should accept parameters (distance)
- Use Inheritance (Shape class instead of two Circles and Rectangles array)
- fix async (sequential ordering) animations (DELAY)
- Delay after each function call
- Delete object
- Partial draft outline
- addObject also should accept parameters (what kind of object, size, color, position)
- Slider bar for delay
- changeParams for color and size
- Appendix of commands




ISSUES:
- Async calls of setState/clearCanvas

DEADLINES:
- Draft of paper by Nov. 18
- Animations of shapes (rather than code)
- Goal is to get to data structure visualizations  similar to python tutor (no shapes)
- Advantage of shapes: color code, highlight as you step through array
- Python tutor shows CHANGES, where I can HIGHLIGHT 
- Make it clear to user WHERE THE CHANGE HAPPENS
- Focus on manipulating the data structure as opposed to showing everything in program
