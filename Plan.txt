Front end:
- moveRelative should be controlled by the Canvas
- Use Inheritance (Shape class instead of two Circles and Rectangles array)
- moveRelative should accept parameters (distance)
- addObject also should accept parameters (what kind of object, size, color, position)

Back end:
- Make API calls like moveRelative()
