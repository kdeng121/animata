Front end:
- moveRelative should be controlled by the Canvas
- moveRelative should accept parameters (distance)
- Use Inheritance (Shape class instead of two Circles and Rectangles array)

- addObject also should accept parameters (what kind of object, size, color, position)

Back end:
- Make API calls like moveRelative()


ISSUES:
- Async calls of setState/clearCanvas
